## 🔧 Features

### 2. 🛑 *Fake Review Detection Model*
We use *Gemini AI* and custom logic to:
- *Block reviews* from users who haven't purchased the product
- Analyze and *label reviews* as Potential Spam 
- Improve the authenticity of product feedback shown to customers

> 📌 Only verified buyers can submit reviews.

### 3. 📦 *Open Box Delivery Option*
Added an option during checkout where customers can:
- Request *Open Box Delivery* to inspect the item before final acceptance
- Report discrepancies immediately if the product is not as described

This helps reduce *return frauds* and *boosts buyer confidence*.
